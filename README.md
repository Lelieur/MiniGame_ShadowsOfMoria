## **Project Description**  
*Shadows of Moria* is a dynamic arcade game developed by **Marta Quiroga** and **Lucas Lelieur**. The objective is to survive waves of enemies, earn points, and avoid hazards. Set in the world of J.R.R Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings', the character, Frodo, will be able to use the unique ring to become invisible to enemies and not take damage. If you are a fan of Middle-earth, you will undoubtedly want to help our protagonist survive the dangers lurking in the shadows of Moria.
